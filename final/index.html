		<h2>Summary</h2>

		<p>
			Our project’s main focus is on modeling the dynamic simulation of lava using the Navier-Stokes equations. We plan to have our fluid (lava) flow down the sides of our volcano. 
		</p>


		<h2>Problem Description</h2>
		<p>
			In general, the problem we are ought to solve is the following - having to model a viscous fluid (lava) as it traverses down our mountainous terrain. We claim that it’s important as it can have direct implications for real-life scenarios, and it can be particularly useful for areas that are prone to this behavior such as Hawaii.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although our simulation won’t account for all the complexity that can potentially lie on a volcano (trees, bushes, houses, rock formations, etc), it should provide a general intuition for the expected flow of lava down the mountain. This project is challenging in that we have to use the navier-stokes equations as well as model how the lava will interact with our terrain as it flows down. Complexity can scale exponentially depending on realistic we decide to make this terrain.

		<h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
		
			<h4> What we plan to deliver </h4>
				<p>
					Our main goal is to create a working simulation for lava flowing down a volcano/mountain. For us, the quality of our project would stem from the realistic accuracy of the fluid flow. We want to ensure that the lava has a viscosity that would parallel that which we might find in real life. In addition, a part of this goal for quality would stem from how pleasing our project is to the eye. Of course, this is a totally subjective matter, but at the very least, we’d like for there to be no room for interpretation in regards to our project - anyone should be able to discern that it’s indeed a volcano with lava flowing out of it. That is the bare minimum. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In regards to the metrics that we will use to determine the success of our system, we can focus on rendering metrics such as the time to render frames, or in a lighting sense, how the light’s irradiance is reflected on the display and also how external light sources might have an impact on the irradiance on the volcano’s surface. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Diving more into lava as a light source, lava’s emission is something that we will need to take into consideration to represent a glow of sorts. There are many considerations when using lava, such as how it might illuminate the air, and how this might differ with the quantity of lava that we choose to be in our render. 
				</p>

			<h4> What we hope to deliver</h4>
				<p>
					If we get ahead of our schedule, and get the bare bones implementation finished, our team is hoping to add more complexity to the mountain to make the system more realistic. We believe that this task would be very challenging, but also really rewarding if done correctly. This includes adding aspects such as the action of lava first spewing into the air rather than a natural downward motion, or the inclusion of objects which might be engulfed in the lava, among other ideas which we had. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In regards to aspirations that we have with illuminating the surrounding area, we believe aspirations can include accounting for the illumination that might occur as a result of lava, such as a darker global image due to ash and smoke, while also maintaining the illumination from the lava itself. Other aspirations include use different rock formations to represent our volcano, where the lava colliding will take the shape of the different formations on the volcano, different to a strictly smooth surface. 
				</p>

			<h4> Questions to consider </h4>
			<p>
				What objects should we add to the mountain to make it more realistic?
			</p>

			<p> 
				How would the lava interact with these new objects?
			</p>

			<p>
				How would this added complexity affect the performance of our overall system. would the system render smoothly still with all this added work and calculations that would need to be done?
			</p>
